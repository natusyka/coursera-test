          <p> Being healthy is better than being unhealthy. Regular physical activity combined with conscientious lifestyle habits will have a tremendously positive effect on a person’s entire life. People can often compartmentalize healthy living as a supplementary endeavor, something to be considered only after taking care of essential needs. While part of this logic is accurate, it misses how an individual can incorporate healthier choices into their daily habits, so that it does not feel as if one has to modify their behavior to improve their wellbeing. This may seem like a stretch, but the first step in making healthier choices for oneself begins with finding positive changes that first and foremost work with a person’s livelihood; if a person cannot find enjoyment in cooking or has to force themselves to eat a food they do not like, it will be next to impossible for them to make these changes permanent fixtures in their routine. Only by creating a plan unique to their needs and personality can a person make lasting changes to their habits that will benefit their overall wellbeing. But how can a person find healthier lifestyle options that work them? What are some of the areas in which an individual could think about improving their lives? It is useful to divide up a person’s wellbeing into three categories that can help a person better understand the factors that influence their health and wellbeing. These three categories are diet, activity, and mental health. Each of these three aspects of an individual plays a tremendous role in determining how healthy a person will be and will have countless positive effects for that person. These aspects are all intertwined: a person’s diet will impact their ability to perform activities; a person’s participation in activities will benefit their mental health; and a person’s state of mental health will influence their motivation and initiative to carry out positive changes to their eating and exercise habits. By understanding how different aspects of their wellbeing impact one another, an individual can take productive steps to improve their health holistically. Understanding how one’s lifestyle and behavior can impact their health can help a person identify useful strategies for improving their habits and their quality of life overall. Here is some useful information about the three categories of wellbeing and how a person can analyze their habits by breaking them down into these different divisions.</p>
